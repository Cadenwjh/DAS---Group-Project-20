# Dallas Animal Shelter Analysis - Group 20

## Introduction
Welcome to the Group 20 - Data Analysis Skill project repository, featuring our analysis of the Dallas Animal Shelter Dataset. This project was part of our coursework, focusing on uncovering the determinants of shelter stay duration for animals through rigorous Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and advanced statistical modeling in R using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM).

## Repository Structure
Our repository is organized into several directories for ease of navigation and consistency:
- **data/**: Contains the dataset and any additional data-related resources.
- **docs/**: Includes project documentation, reports, and findings.
- **R/**: Stores R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- **figures/**: Holds generated plots and figures from the analysis.

## Branches
- `main`: The main branch includes the final versions of our code and comprehensive documentation.
- `Explanatory-Data-Analysis`: This branch is dedicated to Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) work, including visualizations and intermediate insights.
- `Analysis`: Focuses on the deeper statistical analysis, dealing with modeling Generalized Linear Model using R and also conclusion generated.
